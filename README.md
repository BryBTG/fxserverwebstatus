# FXServer Check Status
A Small Script I made that will check the status of your FiveM Server once the page has loaded.

Make sure to add the following scripts to your website header, to ensure that the function is called.

Check required files for the scripts (Recommend running these in your header tag) and Styling
Check script.js for the code to enclose in script tags.
